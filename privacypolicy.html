<h1 id="tracking-technologies">Tracking Technologies</h1>

<p>We may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels and other tracking technologies on the Network to help customize the Network and improve your experience. When you access the Network, your personal information is not collected through the use of tracking technology. Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can remove or reject cookies, but be aware that such action could affect the availability and functionality of the Network. You may not decline web beacons.

<h3 id="website-analytics">Website Analytics</h3>
<p>We may also partner with selected third-party vendors, such as to allow tracking technologies and remarketing services on the Network through the use of first-party cookies and third-party cookies, to, among others, analyze and track users’ use of the Network, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online activity. By accessing the Network, you consent to the collection and use of your information by these third-party vendors. You are encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact them directly for responses to your questions. We do not transfer personal information to these third-party vendors.

<p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.

<h1 id="controls-for-do-not-track-features">Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h1>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected.  No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.</p>
